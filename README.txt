When I was buying a used car to replace my old car a few months back, I was getting infuriated because there was no way to filter car dealerships on Facebook marketplace and also on craigslist there were lots of postings pretending to be private sellers even though they were obviously used car dealers. I want to make a Python program that can filter the used car dealers out so I can get some links to private sellers only. Some postings are tagged as dealer postings which should be easy to filter out. Other dealer postings are not so easy because they do not probably tag themselves as dealers to hide this from you bulywhen you click the posting you will see keywords only associated with dealers like “warranty” or “finance.”  When I run the python program it will store a list of postings to a text file with the price, make, model, year and mileage of vehicle and it will give me the link to that posting. It will also have the asking price. 
I can use the requests module in Python to get the web page HTML and then I can parse the text using things like regular expressions and string methods to get all the relevant information. 
I will have the Python program first get the Facebook Marketplace HTML, I will parse the HTML which contains each posting and I will first check if its dealership posting by checking for the “dealer” tag, 
if its not I will discard that information and not store it. I will then check the posting to see if it contains any words only a dealership would use. 
I might have to research these words but words like financing and warranty and credit are good examples of words to search for in the posting that would make it obvious it was a dealer posting. 
I will then do a similar process by using the requests module to get postings from craigslist and then parse the HTML in a similar matter where I filter dealer postings by finding postings tagged as dealers or find keywords for dealers that are hiding that its a used car dealer posting. 
The python program will take all of the information and store to a text file with a link to each posting so I can easily look through cars sold by actual private sellers.
